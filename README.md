# soulium-wallet

The dev server by default expects Soulium to run on http://localhost:3001 - you can set this to a public API.

## Build Setup


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
